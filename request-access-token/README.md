The scripts here let you update an entity's permissions and data.

Copy .env.sample to .env and update with your credentials and the entity to which you want to grant permission.

You can also update the permissions variable.

You run this with the recipient entity Id passed as an environment variable.

```
RECIPIENT_ENTITY_ID=35406633-60f4-48b3-b984-5b5da098526e npm run update
```
